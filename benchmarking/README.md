# AdNauseam Benchmarking

Automated browsing sessions to test AdNauseam's ad detection and clicking.

## Setup

Requires [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) and Node.js.

```sh
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the extension (from this folder)
npm run build-ext
```

Edit `config.js` if your Chromium path differs from `/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.

## Usage

### Quick test (just opens the browser with AdNauseam)

```sh
npm run test-ext
```

### Run a benchmark

```sh
npm start
```

This reads `script.json`, visits each site, scrolls, optionally clicks subpages, then collects results.

## script.json

Define what sites to visit:

```json
[
  { "url": "https://www.nytimes.com",  "stay": 10, "subpages": 2 },
  { "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news", "stay": 10, "subpages": 0 }
]
```

| Field      | Description                              | Default |
|------------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `url`      | Site to visit                            | —       |
| `stay`     | Seconds to spend on the page             | `10`    |
| `subpages` | Number of internal links to click into   | `0`     |

## AdNauseam settings

Place an `adn_config.json` file in this folder (exported from AdNauseam's "Back up to file" button). The `test-ext` script restores it automatically on launch.

## Results

After a benchmark run, three files are saved to `results/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `summary-*.md` | Human-readable summary with ads per site |
| `benchmark-*.json` | Full data (all ads, blocking stats, page visits) |
| `benchmark-*.log.txt` | Verbose log of the entire session |

Example summary:
